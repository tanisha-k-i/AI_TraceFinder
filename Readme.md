#  AI TraceFinder — Forensic Scanner Identification  

##  Overview  
AI TraceFinder is a forensic machine learning platform that identifies the **source scanner device** used to digitize a document or image. Each scanner (brand/model) introduces unique **noise, texture, and compression artifacts** that serve as a fingerprint. By analyzing these patterns, AI TraceFinder enables **fraud detection, authentication, and forensic validation** in scanned documents.

##  Goals & Objectives  
- Collect and label scanned document datasets from multiple scanners  
- Robust preprocessing (resize, grayscale, normalize, denoise)  
- Extract scanner-specific features (noise, FFT, PRNU, texture descriptors)  
- Train classification models (ML + CNN)  
- Apply explainability tools (Grad-CAM, SHAP)  
- **Deploy an interactive app for scanner source identification**  
- Deliver **accurate, interpretable results** for forensic and legal use cases

##  Methodology 
1. **Data Collection & Labeling**  
   - Gather scans from 3–5 scanner models/brands  
   - Create a structured, labeled dataset  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Resize, grayscale, normalize  
   - Optional: denoise to highlight artifacts  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - PRNU patterns, FFT, texture descriptors (LBP, edge features)  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Baseline ML: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
   - Deep Learning: CNN with augmentation  

5. **Evaluation & Explainability**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  
   - Interpretability: Grad-CAM, SHAP feature maps  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Streamlit app → upload scanned image → predict scanner model  
   - Display confidence score and key feature regions

##  Actionable Insights for Forensics  
- **Source Attribution:** Identify which scanner created a scanned copy of a document.  
- **Fraud Detection:** Detect forgeries where unauthorized scanners were used.  
- **Legal Verification:** Validate whether scanned evidence originated from approved devices.  
- **Tamper Resistance:** Differentiate between authentic vs. tampered scans.  
- **Explainability:** Provide visual evidence of how classification was made.

## ⏳ 8-Week Roadmap (Milestones)  
- **W1:** Dataset collection (min. 3–5 scanners), labeling, metadata analysis  
- **W2:** Preprocessing pipeline (resize, grayscale, normalize, optional denoise)  
- **W3:** Feature extraction (noise maps, FFT, LBP, texture descriptors)  
- **W4:** Baseline ML models (SVM, RF, Logistic Regression) + evaluation  
- **W5:** CNN model training with augmentation, hyperparameter tuning  
- **W6:** Model evaluation (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix) + Grad-CAM/SHAP analysis  
- **W7:** Streamlit app development → image upload, prediction, confidence output  
- **W8:** Final documentation, results, presentation, and demo handover
